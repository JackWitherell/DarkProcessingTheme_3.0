Dark Processing Theme (for 3.4) based on [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) color theme.
===================

A dark theme for the Processing IDE (a little easier on the eyes!) for Processing 3.0.

For the original theme, see [this repository](https://github.com/jeffThompson/DarkProcessingTheme_3.0)

## CONTENTS  
 
* `theme.txt`: where the magic happens! Somewhat annotated to make it easier to modify yourself  
* `preferences.txt`: also required for color data. Annotated as well.  
* `README.md`: this file  
* `screenshot.png`: a screenshot of the theme

## INSTALLATION  
Before installing anything, be sure to make a copy of the original in case you hate these changes or it breaks something! (If you do have issues, you can just re-install the Processing IDE again.) Just copy the files from this repo into the appropriate location.
  
* **Windows:**
Find where you installed Processing to and Place theme.txt in `\processing-3.4\lib\`. If you can't find where you installed processing to (because you made start button shortcuts) right click any shortcut you find to processing.exe and click open containing folder until you find a folder with \lib\ in it
Place preferences.txt in `AppData\Roaming\Processing`. Shortcut to AppData can be reached by right clicking your start button, clicking run and typing %appdata% in there.
